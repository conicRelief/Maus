Maus
====

Use your Android phone as a wireless mouse for your PC.  

#####How it works
Maus uses a combination of accellerometer readings and a camera input to interpret movement. 
A python script running on your personal computer assumes the role of a peripheral/slave under BLE blue-tooth protocol and listens for mouse action data streaming from an Android device.
